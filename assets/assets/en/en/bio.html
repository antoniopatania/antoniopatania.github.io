      “In life, I have lived more than one life. I have worked in conservation restoration, artistic ceramics, interior design, and more. Yet my most intimate passion has always been—and still is—painting. Nothing, like painting, awakens and heals me.”
    </div>

    <p class="lead">
      Antonio Patania was born in San Giovanni La Punta, near Catania, on September 5, 1960. He grew up immersed in Sicilian artistic craftsmanship, within a family deeply connected to traditional puppet-making and decorative arts.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      In 1985 he graduated as Maestro d’Arte from the Istituto d’Arte di Giarre. His professional path unfolded across multiple artistic fields: from puppet making to pictorial and conservation restoration, and from architectural ceramics to decorative works for interior and exterior spaces.

    <p class="lead">
      Alongside these practices, painting has always remained at the core of his personal research. His early series explore the loss of the feminine soul through the gaze: faces appear flawless yet emptied, decorative, devoid of inner life.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      In more recent works, Patania’s research weaves together past and present—mythological enigmas and Sicilian folklore, baroque ornamentation, and vibrant color. The gaze alternates between concealment and revelation, opening toward renewed awareness.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      Raised within the epic universe of traditional Sicilian puppet theatre, Patania absorbed from an early age an imagery shaped by heroes, armor, and symbolic narratives. In his painting, the Paladins become metaphors for the contemporary human condition—figures that defend themselves, expose themselves, and struggle.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      His first mentor was the painter Natale Napoli, who created stage sets for puppet theatre. The influence of Renato Guttuso is also evident, particularly in the incisive mark-making and expressive use of color, reinterpreted within a personal research that weaves together memory, identity, and introspection.
